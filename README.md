# Overview of UFO Sightings project:
Create a table in JavaScript that allows a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on Dana's already working webpage and dynamic table. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Resources
- Data Source: data.js (UFO data)
- Date Tools: JavaScript-ES6, Python and MongoDB
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, BootStrap

### Step by Step explanation how someone can use the filter Search table.


## Search Criteria
- In the filter search table

# Summary
- One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. 
  For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table and find the city desired for the analysis.
  
- A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields.
  Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
